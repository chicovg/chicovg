### Hello, I'm Victor üëã

I'm a senior full-stack engineer located in the Washington, D.C. area.

I use this space for learning mostly, I've also been curious to try new languages and frameworks and, in most cases, those experiments will end up here.  Here are some of my favorite projects:

#### üç∫ The Drink List / Rate that Drink 
I'm a big craft beer fan and I think it's fun to rate different beers a write about my preferences.  There are a ton of platforms out there that do this, but I wanted something that I could tweak as needed.  This project helped my explore the Clojure(Script) ecosystem so I ended up writing and re-writing it several times with both a full-stack and frontend only version.

[the-drink-list](https://github.com/chicovg/the-drink-list): A SPA built with: Clojurescript, [uix](https://github.com/pitch-io/uix), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

[rate-that-drink](https://github.com/chicovg/rate-that-drink): (older version) A full-stack MPA built with: Clojure/Clojurescript, [luminus](https://github.com/luminus-framework)
  
#### üë∂ [baby-log](https://github.com/chicovg/baby-log)

When my partner and I had our first child, we were concerned about sticking to the feeding and diaper schedule, so I build a simple React app to help us keep track.  It turned out to be just a valuable tool for us.

Built with: JavaScript, [React](https://react.dev/), [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

#### [auth-server](https://github.com/chicovg/auth-server)
I needed to level up my understanding of OAuth to help me with a work project, so I built my own example OAuth server and client.

Built with: Clojure/ClojureScript, [luminus](https://github.com/luminus-framework), [buddy-auth](https://github.com/funcool/buddy-auth)

#### GraphQL experiments
I wanted to learn a little bit more about GraphQL for a work project.  I had a few small experiments in both Java and Clojure:

- [spotify-graphql-clj](https://github.com/chicovg/spotify-graphql-clj): A graphql API which wraps the Spotify Web API.
- [package-tracking](https://github.com/chicovg/package-tracking): A graphql service which returns package tracking data for a hypothetical package tracking system.
- [dropwizard-graphql](https://github.com/chicovg/dropwizard-graphql): Adds graphql to a dropwizard service
